		<h1>This will be your heading</h1>
		<p>Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read</p>
		<p>Then you can quote someone to add credibility:</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://hackspirit.com/buddha-quotes/">
			<strong>
				“One is not called noble who harms living beings. By not harming living beings one is called noble.” – The Buddha (Dhammapada, verse
				270)
			</strong>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new generations have this things in common:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
			<li>Have the spawn of attention of a bird.</li>
			<li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.</li>
		</ul>
